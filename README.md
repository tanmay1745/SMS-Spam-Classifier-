## 📱 SMS Spam Classifier  
An end-to-end machine learning project to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

### 🔍 Project Overview  
This project includes data collection, text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and a Streamlit-based user interface for real-time predictions.

---

### 🧠 What I Built  
- Collected and explored SMS dataset  
- Cleaned text (lowercase, removing stopwords, stemming)  
- Converted text to numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**  
- Trained a **Naive Bayes** model  
- Saved trained model and vectorizer using pickle  
- Built a **Streamlit UI** for predictions

### 🛠 Tech Stack  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK  
- Streamlit  
- Jupyter Notebook
